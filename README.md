# weekly-projects
This is my attempt at completing 1 project per week. No matter the size or difficulty, I must finish one programming project per week.

## week 1 (Dec 1st 2024 - Dec 7th 2024)
This week I am attempting to make a console application that has a Server and Client, the goal is to for both parties to be able to send messages to eachother in any order, I beleive some sort of threading will be necessary, to always be reading and writing to the console.
