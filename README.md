# weekly-projects
This is my attempt at completing 1 project per week. No matter the size or difficulty, I must finish one programming project per week.

## week 1 (Dec 1st 2024 - Dec 7th 2024)
This week I am attempting to make a console application that has a Server and Client, the goal is to for both parties to be able to send messages to eachother in any order, I beleive some sort of threading will be necessary, to always be reading and writing to the console.

## week 2 (Dec 8th 2024 - Dec 14th 2024)
This week I am attempting to recreate an old snake game I made when I was younger. Last time I made it, I had essentially copy-pasted all of the code. This time, I will attempt to do it all with my own knowledge.

I ended up not really knowing how to make a "game" in JS considering all we were taught in CSCI1170 was really just event listeners, so I based my project heavily off of this amazing, simple video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs. With that said though it isn't a line for line copy of his work, I just used the tutorial to get the basic snake logic, and especially the setInterval() method, which I was lost without.
